# What the program does
This website has features to inform users about what we are about, it provides information about the current pandemic, and all in all is an interactive blog website. Users can interact with one another through thought-provoking posts or comments, users can also make and edit profiles.

# Usage
First like most websites a user has to start by creating an account by using first name and last name, your preferred email to use for the account, and a preferred string password. Once done with making the account a user has the option of customizing their profile to their liking, with the option of changing their name, email address, or adding a biography to let others be more informed about you. The edit profile button also allows users to add an imagine as their profile picture.

A user is able to make post by clicking on the blog categories section and choosing between the three- four categories listed. Upon clicking on one of the categories the user is able to make their own post so that other can view it.

After making a post on our website a user can go to the blog post section and either view theirs or others posts. When looking at others post a user is able to comment, like or dislike a post. We’ve implemented the comment section so that our users can share their thoughts about one’s post to other users and eventually start a thread of comments.

# Warnings and other important information
